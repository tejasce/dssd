# build environment and use the test tree located here in our source directory.
# To generate the golden result file test/test.xml when qat itself changes,
# replace -g with -j (keeping the argument the same) -- this will report FAIL
# as a result of the test tree itself generating failures, but will leave XML.
# To debug -g failures, change -K to -k in TEST_ARGS to retain /tmp/qat*
